# Proposal

## Problem statement

<!-- Start with a concise description of the problem you're trying to solve. Don't talk about possible solutions yet. -->

## Motivating examples or use cases

<!-- Next add any motivating examples. Examples should ideally be real world examples, or minimized versions of the real world example in scenarios where the motivating code is not open source. Don't propose changes you think might *hypothetically* be useful; real use cases help make sure we have the right design. -->

## Solution sketch

<!--
If you have a sketch of a concrete solution, please include it here. You don't have to have all the details worked out, but it should be enough to convey the idea.

If you want to quickly check whether *any* some solution to the problem would be acceptable, you can delete this section.
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
Please also discuss alternative solutions to the problem. Include any reasoning for why you didn't suggest those as the primary solution.

Could this be written using existing APIs? If so, roughly what would that look like? Why does it need to be different? Could this be done as a crate on crates.io?
-->

## Links and related work

<!-- Provide links to any <https://internals.rust-lang.org> thread(s), github issues, approaches to this problem in other languages/libraries, or similar supporting information. -->

## What happens now?

This issue contains an API change proposal (or ACP) and is part of the libs-api team [feature lifecycle]. Once this issue is filed, the libs-api team will review open proposals as capability becomes available. Current response times do not have a clear estimate, but may be up to several months.

## Possible responses

The libs team may respond in various different ways. First, the team will consider the *problem* (this doesn't require any concrete solution or alternatives to have been proposed):

- We think this problem seems worth solving, and the standard library might be the right place to solve it.
- We think that this probably doesn't belong in the standard library.

Second, if there's a concrete solution:

- We think this specific solution looks roughly right, approved, you or someone else should implement this. (Further review will still happen on the subsequent implementation PR.)
- We're not sure this is the right solution, and the alternatives or other materials don't give us enough information to be sure about that. Here are some questions we have that aren't answered, or rough ideas about alternatives we'd want to see discussed.
